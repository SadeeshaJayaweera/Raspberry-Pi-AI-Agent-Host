## SIM7600E-H 4G HAT for Raspberry Pi (LTE Cat-4)

This is a 4G CAT-4/3G/2G network HAT based on the SIMcom SIM7600E-H for the Raspberry Pi which accepts a 1.8V/3V sim card and supports a range of LTE Cat-4 network bands, including phone calls via AT commands and SMS functionality!

Speeds of up to 50Mbps Uplink* and 150Mbps Downlink* are possible on a 4G network via the onboard SIMcom SIM7600E-H module. The HAT supports GNSS positioning via the GPS, Beidou, GLONASS and LBS Base satellite systems and includes an onboard audio jack and audio decoder support making telephone calls.

The HAT includes a USB interface for testing AT commands, obtaining GPS data etc, whilst the onboard CP2102 UART converter allows for serial debugging. UART breakout pins are also included for use with other development boards. LED indicators assist with debugging, showing the operating status.

A MicroSD card slot is included on the board for storing data such as messages and files. Included in the package is the HAT, an LTE antenna, external GPS antenna, two Micro-USB cables and fixings!
