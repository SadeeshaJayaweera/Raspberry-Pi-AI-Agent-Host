# Raspberry Pi AI Agent Host

The AI Agent Host was tested on DietPi. No other Linux distributions have been tested. The AI Agent Host offers several features that make it an ideal environment for AI development on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM:

1. **Modular Environment**: The AI Agent Host is built as a module-based system, allowing different components to be added or removed based on the requirements of the project. This is perfect for the customizable nature of Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, by adding an AI Agent container, the AI Agent Host can be transformed into an AI Agent Lab, expanding its capabilities for AI development and experimentation.

2. **Live Data Interaction**: With the ability to work with live data from both APIs and Raspberry Pi's own sensors, AI Agent Host becomes a powerful tool for real-time data analysis, modeling, and decision-making.

3. **Lightweight Services**: Services like QuestDB and Grafana used in the AI Agent Host are lightweight yet robust, making them suitable for the Raspberry Pi's limited hardware resources compared to larger servers.

4. **Remote Development Capabilities**: The inclusion of Code-Server allows you to connect to a remote JupyterHub installed on a powerful GPU Server when necessary, using Raspberry Pi as the Docker host.

5. **Data Handling and Visualization**: QuestDB for efficient data handling and Grafana for intuitive data visualization are integral for any AI and machine learning projects.

6. **Optimized for DietPi**: The AI Agent Host's compatibility with DietPi, a lightweight OS optimized for single-board computers like Raspberry Pi, ensures efficient use of the Raspberry Pi's hardware resources.

7. **Community Support**: With active communities for both Raspberry Pi and AI Agent Host, you can expect robust support and resources for your AI development projects.

These features make the AI Agent Host a dynamic, effective, and efficient environment for AI development on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM, especially for projects involving real-time or sensor data.
