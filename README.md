# Raspberry Pi AI Agent Host


**Simplified Summary:** The AI Agent Host is a setup that allows AI applications to run directly on a Raspberry Pi. These applications can interact with live data to make decisions or predictions, and the setup can be customized according to the project's needs. The AI Agent Host also works with a powerful GPU server for demanding tasks. It uses lightweight services suitable for the Raspberry Pi's resources and is optimized for DietPi, a lightweight operating system ideal for Raspberry Pi



The [AI Agent Host](https://github.com/quantiota/AI-Agent-Host), designed specifically for AI development, offers several key features making it an ideal solution for Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM, especially when running DietPi OS:

1. **Modular Environment**: The AI Agent Host is built as a module-based system, allowing different components to be added or removed based on the requirements of the project. This is perfect for the customizable nature of Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, by adding an AI Agent container, the AI Agent Host can be transformed into an AI Agent Lab, expanding its capabilities for AI development and experimentation.

2. **Live Data Interaction**: With the ability to work with live data from both APIs and Raspberry Pi's own sensors, AI Agent Host becomes a powerful tool for real-time data analysis, modeling, and decision-making.

3. **Lightweight Services**: Services like QuestDB and Grafana used in the AI Agent Host are lightweight yet robust, making them suitable for the Raspberry Pi's limited hardware resources compared to larger servers.

4. **Remote Development Capabilities**: The inclusion of Code-Server allows you to connect to a remote JupyterHub installed on a powerful GPU Server when necessary, using Raspberry Pi as the Docker host.

5. **Data Handling and Visualization**: QuestDB for efficient data handling and Grafana for intuitive data visualization are integral for any AI and machine learning projects.

6. **Optimized for DietPi**: The AI Agent Host's compatibility with DietPi, a lightweight OS optimized for single-board computers like Raspberry Pi, ensures efficient use of the Raspberry Pi's hardware resources.

7. **Community Support**: With active communities for both Raspberry Pi and AI Agent Host, you can expect robust support and resources for your AI development projects.

These features make the AI Agent Host a dynamic, effective, and efficient environment for AI development on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 8GB RAM, especially for projects involving real-time or sensor data.


## AI Agent Host: A Novel Approach to Edge Computing

The AI Agent Host offers an innovative setup, connecting edge devices like the Raspberry Pi to a JupyterHub on a remote GPU server. This unique configuration, part of a broader trend known as edge computing, enables real-time data analysis and decision-making on the edge while offloading computationally intensive tasks to a GPU server in the cloud.

While this specific setup is not commonly seen or standardized, it adds significant value to fields that require real-time data analysis and decision-making capabilities at the edge. Potential applications include autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, and more.

One of the primary challenges in edge computing is developing an infrastructure that allows for seamless communication and integration between edge devices and cloud servers. The AI Agent Host provides a powerful solution to this challenge, offering a framework that could potentially standardize these interactions.

As the AI industry continues to evolve rapidly, this innovative approach may become more commonplace. The AI Agent Host is at the forefront of this technological development, paving the way for new use cases and implementations.

Please note that while we strive to keep this document up-to-date, the field of AI is continuously evolving. For the latest information and developments, we recommend staying active in relevant online communities and keeping up with the latest research.


## Getting Started 

The AI Agent Host was tested on DietPi installed on a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB. No other Linux distributions have been tested, but the instructions should be reasonably straightforward to adapt.

To test the AI Agent Host, follow these steps:

1. Set up or use an existing environment with Docker installed.

Run dietpi-software from the command line.

```
dietpi-software
```

Choose Browse Software and select Docker Compose, Docker and Git. Finally select Install.
DietPi will do all the necessary steps to install and start these software items.


```

             │  [*] 134  Docker Compose: Manage multi-container Docker applications                 
             │  [ ] 142  MicroK8s: The simplest production-grade upstream K8s, light and focused     
             │  [*] 162  Docker: Build, ship, and run distributed applications    

             |  [*] 17   Git: Clone and manage Git repositories locally                                  

```

2. Clone the AI Agent Host repository and navigate to the docker directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/quantiota/AI-Agent-Host.git
cd AI-Agent-Host/docker

```

Then follow the prerequiste section on this [Tutorial](https://github.com/quantiota/AI-Agent-Host/tree/main/tests) for guidance.
